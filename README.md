# Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio website where I keep track of all projects I develop.

It has been built using Bootstrap CSS framework with a mobile responsive layout.

I am going to be constantly updating this portifolio with my new completed projects, and I will probably change stuff around on every update.
